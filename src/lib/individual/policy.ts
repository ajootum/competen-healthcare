// ── COMPETEN INDIVIDUAL POLICY ── COMPETEN-CONFIG-002 items 4-7 ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The values an Individual Product Administrator may set without code, held in the EXISTING Workspace
// Configuration Engine (migration 076) and written through its shared lifecycle
// (src/lib/config/workspace-config-write.ts). Not a second configuration system.
//
// ⚠ WHERE THEY LIVE. workspace_config_overrides at scope_type 'platform', scope_ref 'individual', one row
// per policy at config_path 'individual.policy.<key>'. The super-admin WCE door pins platform scope to
// scope_ref 'platform', so a workspace publish never sweeps an Individual draft into its version, and the
// other way round. Versions and audit are workspace_config_versions and workspace_config_audit.
//
// ⚠ THE HARD LIMITS ARE HERE, IN CODE, AND NOTHING WRITES THEM. Every policy has an immutable range. A
// write outside it is REFUSED (the route answers 422). A value read back outside it -- written by another
// door, restored by a rollback, or typed into the table by hand -- is CLAMPED, so no stored value can take
// a consumer past its limit. An unreadable store, an absent row or a malformed value falls back to the
// constant the consumer used before this file existed, so turning the engine off changes nothing.
//
// ⚠ EFFECTIVE MEANS PUBLISHED. WCE has no effective-date column: a value takes effect when its version is
// published (workspace_config_versions.created_at, the database clock). Scheduling a future date needs a
// schema addition, proposed in the build record and not built.
//
// ⚠ NOT HERE, ON PURPOSE: the individual_app release gate (owner-only activation, CONFIG-002 item 3), and
// the limits the schema enforces (the 10 MB upload cap, the MIME types, four answer options). A policy
// can only ever be as wide as what the database already allows.
